# blink-fast

A game where a cell changes each time you blink. You have to click the cell that changed. Streaks multiply your score, wrong guesses reset it.

You might need to adjust blink_threshold = 0.18

Higher FPS cameras will result in a faster latency

Installation:
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- python3 main.py
